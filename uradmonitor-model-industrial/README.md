## Thinger.io Integration

The MODEL INDUSTRIAL Air Quality Monitoring station can be integrated with Thinger.io to provide real-time data visualization, analytics, and alerts for all monitored air quality parameters.

## Requirements

A LoRaWAN server is required to communicate the MODEL INDUSTRIAL station into Thinger.io, some options are:

- [The Things Stack](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/stack/)
- [LORIOT](https://loriot.io/)
- [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/)

Alongside, the corresponding plugin for the selected LoRaWAN server needs to be installed in your Thinger.io instance.

## Get Started

### Installation

Look for the plugin in the [Thinger.io Plugin Store](https://marketplace.thinger.io/) and install it in your Thinger.io instance. Once the plugin is installed a new Product will be created for this device.

### Configuration

The Product is already preconfigured, check that the auto provision prefix matches the one selected in your LoRaWAN server plugin in Thinger.io, or change it to your desire.

### Usage

Start sending uplinks for autoprovisioning devices and buckets. This product also provides a predefined dashboard for monitoring all 11 air quality parameters in real-time.
