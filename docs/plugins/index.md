# Plugins

Plugins are extensions that allow complementing Thinger.io Platform with additional features or creating integrations with third-party internet services, data analytics algorithms or custom software.

The core of Thinger.io IoT Platform is designed to be lean and lightweight, to maximize flexibility and minimize learning and common configuration of IoT networks.  Plugins offer custom functions that can be deployed on-demand,  allowing each user to complement their IoT server as its specific needs.

## Custom Plugins Development

In order to provide a highly extensive system we are working to make it easy for community developers to contribute through Open Source plugins. Therefore, we have created a dedicated repository and wiki that provides deeply information about the infrastructure that is supporting plugins system and how to build, test and deploy custom ones.
