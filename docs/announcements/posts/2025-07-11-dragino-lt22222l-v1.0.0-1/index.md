# Dragino LT22222L Plugin Version 1.0.0-1

We are pleased to announce official Thinger.io support for the **Dragino LT22222L industrial I/O controller**.  
This plug-in provides a complete *“plug-and-play”* experience: [install the plugin](/plugins/managing/) from the Marketplace and you are ready to operate the device through **any LoRaWAN Network Server** (ChirpStack, Actility, The Things Stack, Helium, …) without writing custom code or decoding scripts.
