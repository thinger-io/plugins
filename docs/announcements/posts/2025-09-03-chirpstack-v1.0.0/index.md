- Store, analyse, and visualise sensor data in real time.

- Extend the power of ChirpStack with Thinger.ioâ€™s dashboards, alerts, and integrations.

As ChirpStack is a **self-hosted network server**, this plugin is designed to give you full control over how your devices interact with the Thinger.io platform, while keeping your LoRaWAN infrastructure under your own management.
