# WIKA PEW‑1000

The WIKA PEW‑1000 is a compact, wireless pressure sensor designed for remote monitoring of gases and liquids. It features LoRaWAN® wireless connectivity and Bluetooth® for local configuration. Built for industrial use, it offers long battery life, robust environmental protection, and high-accuracy pressure readings.

## Thinger.io Integration

To integrate the WIKA PEW‑1000 with Thinger.io, you will need a LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) with it's corresponding Thinger.io plugin.

## Requirements

A LoRaWAN server is required to communicate the WIKA PEW‑1000 with Thinger.io. Supported options include:

- [The Things Stack](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/stack/)
- [LORIOT](https://loriot.io/)
- [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/)

Additionally, the corresponding Thinger.io plugin for the selected LoRaWAN server must be installed.

## Get Started

### Installation

Look for the plugin in the [Thinger.io Plugin Store](https://plugins.thinger.io/) and install it in your Thinger.io instance. Once the plugin is installed a new Product will be created for this device.

### Configuration

The Product is preconfigured to support auto-provisioning. Make sure the provisioning prefix matches the configuration used in your LoRaWAN server plugin. You may change this prefix if needed.

If using Bluetooth® for local setup, ensure the device is configured to use LoRaWAN and the appropriate AppEUI/AppKey are set correctly.

## Usage

Begin sending uplink frames from the PEW‑1000. Devices and data buckets will be auto-provisioned in your Thinger.io account.

This plugin also includes:

- A prebuilt dashboard for data visualization.
- Support for downlink commands to remotely configure the sensor.
