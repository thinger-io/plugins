Depending on the configuration done in The Things Stackapplication, this function will receive different inputs:</p> <ul> <li>Base64 String: If The Things Stack application defines <code>Custom Javascript Formatter</code> for the payload but does not provide a decoder function, this method will receive the raw payload encoded in base64. In this case, it will be necessary to write a function to transform this base64 data to a JSON object.</li> <li>JSON Object from Cayene LPP: If The Things Stack application defines a <code>Cayene LPP</code> payload formatter, The Things Stack will automatically convert the binary data to a JSON object that can be used directly by the platform. In this case, it is not necessary to define a custom uplink method unless you want to do some extra processing like incorporating calculated fields.</li> <li>JSON Object from Custom Decoder: If The Things Stack application defines <code>Custom Javascript Formatter</code>for the payload and provides a decoder function, this function will receive the output from The Things Stack function. In this case, creating a custom uplink method will be redundant, so create the function in The Things Stack, or in the plugin.</li> </ul> <p>The output of this method must be always a JSON object containing the information that is necessary to be used by the platform. In the following, there is an uplink method that converts base64 data into a JSON object with <code>temperature</code> and <code>humidity</code> parsed from the binary data.</p> <pre><code>/* convert a base64 payload to a JSON object that can be used \n  by Thinger.io */\nmodule.exports.uplink = function(payload){\n    const buffer = Buffer.from(payload, 'base64');\n    let processed = {};\n    processed.temperature = buffer.readInt16LE(0)/100.0;\n    processed.humidity = buffer.readInt16LE(2)/100.0;\n    return processed;\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>The uplink method must always return a JSON object.</p> <p>The downlink method will be called before the plugin issues a downlink request to The Things Stack. To issue a downlink request to The Things Stack, this plugin must receive an HTTP POST call, indicating the Thinger.io device identifier, and it will automatically issue the request to the required The Things Stack endpoint and its specific protocol. Check out the next sections for more details.</p> <p>This function will receive different inputs depending on how the plugin is called over its REST API.</p> <ul> <li>JSON Object: If the downlink call is done for a Thinger.io device that defines a <code>downlink</code> property (that is automatically initialized if <code>Initialize Downlink Data</code> is configured in the plugin), this method will receive the JSON content of this property. It usually consists on a user-friendly device configuration that should be later encoded to binary in base64.</li> <li>JSON Object: If the plugin downlink request contains a JSON payload in the POST call, this function will receive this payload instead of the one configured in the device <code>downlink</code> property. </li> </ul> <p>The output of this method should be one of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Base64 String: With binary information that can be sent directly to The Things Stack network. It is required if your The Things Stack application is not defining a converter.</li> <li>JSON Object: Either if The Things Stack application provides a converter for your payloads, this method can return a JSON object that will be accesible in the converter method. In this case, creating a custom downlink method will be redundant, so create the funtion in The Things Stack, or in the plugin. Or, if the f_port needs to be customized, the dedicated <code>f_port</code> to use for the downlink may be specified by having the input message be <code>{ \"f_port\": 1, \"payload\": \"&lt;desired payload to send to the downlink\" }</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Example of a downlink method converting a JSON device configuration into base64 as required by The Things Stack:</p> <pre><code>/* convert a JSON object with the device configuration in a base64\n  string expected by The Things Stack */\nmodule.exports.downlink = function(payload){\n    let bytes = [];\n    bytes[0] = payload.enabled ? 1 : 0;\n    bytes[1] = payload.frequency;\n    bytes[2] = payload.threshold;\n    return Buffer.from(bytes).toString('base64');\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>The downlink method should return a base64 string if The Things Stack application does not define a converter.</p>"},{"location":"plugins/connectivity/ttn-stack/#the-things-stack-console-configuration","title":"The Things Stack Console Configuration","text":""},{"location":"plugins/connectivity/ttn-stack/#uplink-configuration","title":"Uplink Configuration","text":"<p>The last tab of the plugin configuration interface is called \"Webhook settings\", it has been created to help the developers to complete the integration in The Things Stack Console, by providing all the information required to set up the webhook profile. </p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>Note that the REST API does not define the application ID, this parameter will be checked by the plugin software to manage the payload according to the configuration.</p> <p>To create a new webhook integration follow the next steps in The Things Stack web console: 1.
