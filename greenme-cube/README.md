I don't have access to web search or fetch capabilities to look up verified technical information about the "Cube - Environment Sensor" device. Without being able to verify the device specifications, manufacturer, and technical details from official sources, I cannot produce accurate documentation that meets your requirements for verified information only.

To proceed, I would need either:

1. **Permission to use web search/fetch tools** to research the device specifications
2. **Additional device metadata** provided directly, such as:
   - Manufacturer name
   - Specific sensors included (temperature, humidity, CO2, etc.)
   - Communication protocol details (LoRaWAN class, frequency bands)
   - Power specifications
   - Official documentation URLs

Would you like to provide additional device information, or grant permission for web research?
